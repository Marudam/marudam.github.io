<p align="justify">At Marudam Farm School, we are interested in deeply committed teachers who are keen to continue learning and developing on a personal level.</p>
<p align="justify">As a group, we work in a non-hierarchical and cooperative environment. We are a teacher-run school and all decisions are taken by the teaching staff. Decisions are not made on a ‘one person, one vote’ basis but rather through dialogue and consensus. Each member of staff is completely responsible for the school. </p>
<p align="justify">Please email us - <a href="mailto:marudamfarmschool@gmail.com?subject=Teacher Application">marudamfarmschool@gmail.com</a> (subject: Teacher Application) if you are interested in working at Marudam. Include in your email a brief summary of your teaching background and/or skills, explaining your interest in education and learning generally, and in working at Marudam Farm School in particular.</p>
