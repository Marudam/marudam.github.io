   <h1>Hi there!</h1>
   <p>Marudam Farm School is located on an organic farm on the outskirts of Thiruvannamalai, in the state of Tamil Nadu, South of India. As a community, we are committed to explore what it means to live and learn together. This may include learning about ourselves... about others... the intricate web of relationships which connects us... It may also include acquiring various life skills and academic foundations... as well as trying to live sustainably in this rapidly changing world... We hope that these explorations will help us to meet Life's challenges with greater intelligence and sensitivity.></p>
