<p align="justify">We view volunteers, both short and long term, as a valuable asset to the school. At the moment, volunteers at the school could really help in the following areas:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Creating bilingual learning aids for language learning - flash cards, phonics cards, word family flip books, sentence builders etc.</li>
  <li>Creating an audio and video library, especially audio books.</li>
  <li>Craft and life skills workshops (ideally 6 weeks of commitment). Alternately, we would consider a workshop-based approach for 2 weeks where one could have a series of workshops to explore different crafts/skills through the day. Currently we are interested in people who may be especially skilled in woodwork and sculpture.</li>
  <li>An artist / crafts person in residence i.e. someone who may be residing on campus working on an independent specific project where the children could learn through observation and informal interaction.â€¨</li>
  <li>Work on the organic farm: the nature of the work will depend on the season - planting, weeding, threshing etc. If the volunteer is well-versed with farm work, then there is an option to interact with the children as well.</li>
  <li>Work on our afforestation project: "The Forest Way" has been carrying out afforestation on the Arunachala hill for many years now. The group also does environmental education for children for local schools who visit the park run by the trust. It is possible to volunteer in these contexts too.</li>
