<p>Location: Marudam is located at Kananthampoondi village, off the Sathanur Dam Road. The school is around 4 kms outside of Thiruvannamalai town and 6 km from Ramana Ashram. </p>
<p>How to reach : From Tiruvannamalai town, Travel down the Sathanur dam road, also known as Kallakurichi road, for about 3 km, beyond two churches located on either side of the road. 100 meters after the second church, turn right into the bypass road and follow it for about 2 km. You will see a "Marudam Farm" sign board pointing to a narrower road, which should be followed for another km. A wooden board in on the right is located just outside the school campus. </p>
